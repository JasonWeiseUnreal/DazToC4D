This is here to represent where to find custom variables stored in the scene.

During the import we are store in the direct DTU into the scene

To look it up we need to find use the Genesis Skeleton

The Character Custom Variables are stored in memory with the ID at the 

GUID 

For Example Bellow will find us the DTU as a String Type

c4d.documents.GetActiveDocument()[ob.GetGUID()][1000]

To Convert it we use the json.loads() to convert back to an object in python


*** ob is found by search the root bone on the skeleton of Genesis Import****
Table of Contents:
    ob.GetGUID() : Represents the location of the Variables in the Scene
    1000 : DTU
    2000 : Skeleton name
    3000 : Body name
